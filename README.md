This is a FrontEnd Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenge. I had to make a list of jobs and a search filter. I did this project with React Js. The search filter works, but i dont know why, React doesn't recognize .toLowerCase, so if you want to use the search filter, you must write the first letter in capital letters ("Frontend", "Backend", "Junior", etc).

I'll improve the search filter.
